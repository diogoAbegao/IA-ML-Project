# Artificial Intelligence - Image Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

The goal is to train and evaluate different models using a provided dataset, employing both scratch-built models (S models) and transfer learning models (T models).

## Objectives
### In this project, we will:

- Utilize an image dataset for a classification task.
- Train CNN-based models for image classification.
- Compare models trained from scratch (S models) and models using transfer learning (T models).
- Analyze performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
- Document all experiments, results, and analyses using Jupyter Notebook markdown annotations.


## Project Requirements
The project must meet the following criteria:

### Dataset Handling
- Use RGB images (3 channels).
- Clearly describe the train, validation, and test datasets.

### Model S (From Scratch)
- Design at least one CNN architecture from scratch.
- Use at least two different optimizers.
- Train models with and without data augmentation.

### Model T (Transfer Learning)
- Implement transfer learning with:

### Feature extraction (Fine-tuning)
- Train models with and without data augmentation.
